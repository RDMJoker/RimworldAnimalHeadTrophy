Animal head trophies

Description:
Have you ever wished to hunt a deer and then preserve and mount the deer's head in your recreation room? This mod will let you do exactly that.

More information:
This mod lets you hunt a deer and then "butcher" the head at a butcher's spot or butchers table. You then need to take the deer head to the crafting table and "craft" the preserved deer head and mount it on a pedestal.

The preserved and mounted deer head can be placed in any room to give an art bonus to that room.

Balanced
It takes the same crafting time as a small steel sculpture and provides the same art/beauty value as a small steel sculpture.

BEFORE YOU DOWNLOAD:
Please note that this is an Alpha version. It is functional and it won't break your save game but there are some immersion breaking aspects to this mod that are still under development:

    it uses just one deer head texture no matter what animal you preserve - to be fixed in future versions
    you can create a deer head from any corpse - even a turtle head! To be fixed in future versions


At the moment, this mod allows you to craft a deer head to place in every room. With help from this community I'll strive to making this a fully fledged mod.

Adding this mod won't break your save game.
